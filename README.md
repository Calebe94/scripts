# scripts

A compilations of scripts that I use daily

## Monitor and Audio setup

The `monitor_setup.sh` and `audio_setup.sh` was designed to automaticaly setup when my HDMI monitor is plugged.

The `monitor.rules` should be edited with the user and scripts path and then should be coppied to `/etc/udev/rules.d/98-monitor-hotplug.rules`.
